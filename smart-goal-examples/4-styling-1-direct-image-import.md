# SMART
## Specific
- use direct images in the footer component

## Measurable
- 1 south side stand logo
- 3 social media logos

## Attainable
- [Importing assets into files](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/importing-assets-into-files/)
- [See example from header.js](https://github.com/peterbsmith2/south-side-stand/blob/master/site/src/components/header.js)

## Relevant
- Direct asset imports are good for "above the fold" image loading
- these are "eagerly loaded" assets, not "lazy loaded" assets

## Time-bound

"Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demand" means that you get good at what you practice. If you read tutorials you get better at reading tutorials. If you write code you get better at writing code.

<!--GENERAL NOTE IN RELATION TO CLICKABLE CONTENT: Read on stackoverflow that nesting the type of clickable
element I want in a form element could fix the issue of linking that component to other parts of the webpage,
social media, ect.-->
    <body>
        <main>
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Section 1 content</legend>

<!--A key aspect of this, and I believe the other sections, is having the background image. Not sure if it matters
where its <img> tag goes, but this seems like a styling issue.-->
                <div id="section 1">
                    <div id="background image">
                        <img src="" alt="placeholder for background image">
                    </div><br>

                    <div id="company logo">
                        <img src="" alt="placeholder for company logo">
                    </div><br>

<!--W3 website has example CSS for when we get to stlying. They had <a> set up for the icons, which made sense
considering that clicking the icon takes you to the social media page.-->
                    <div id="social media icons">
                        <a href="#">Facebook</a>
                        <a href="#">Twitter</a>
                        <a href="#">Instagram</a>
                        <a href="#">Pinterest</a>
                    </div><br>

<!--My first thought was buttons, but <a> seems equally plausible considering that clicking the option should 
theoretically take you to another page on the site. Not sure how it works with JS, but maybe it can be 
accomplished both ways?-->
                    <div id="navigation bar">
                        <a href="#">Home</a>
                        <a href="#">About Us</a>
                        <a href="#">Branches & ATMs</a>
                        <a href="#">Contact Us</a>

<!--The example image kind of makes this section look like a set of drop-down options except for the last option
for logging in. And by "making it look like" I mean it looks like what I would usually except a set of drop-downs
to look like whenever I encounter them on webpages. If they are intended to be drop-downs, my main guess is that
we will have to use <select> and use CSS to make the option appear like it does in the image (ie. the title of the
option), and then have a "hover" property when a user places their cursor over the option for whatever the "options"
are for that...option. But again, for the sake of placeholders, it seems like <a> is a good option for now.-->
                    <div id="options tab">

the difference in text size for this section until we start incorporating CSS.-->

the most logical guess for the HTML. Still assuming that JS will play a big role in handling that functionality
as was previously discussed.-->

In other words, they will have the same dimensions and be displayed horizontally when CSS is used. The general
note from above is related to these sections in particular (ie. nesting the buttons in a form element later on.

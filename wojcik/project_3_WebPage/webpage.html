    <!--A key aspect of this, and I believe the other sections, is having the background image. Not sure if it matters
    where its <img> tag goes, but this seems like a styling issue.-->

    <!--W3 website has example CSS for when we get to stlying. They had <a> set up for the icons, which made sense
    considering that clicking the icon takes you to the social media page.-->
                    <div id="social media icons">
                        <a href="#">Facebook</a>
                        <a href="#">Twitter</a>

                        <a href="#">Pinterest</a>
                    </div><br>

    <!--My first thought was buttons, but <a> seems equally plausible considering that clicking the option should 
    theoretically take you to another page on the site. Not sure how it works with JS, but maybe it can be 
    accomplished both ways?-->
                    <div id="navigation bar">
                        <a href="#">Home</a>
                        <a href="#">About Us</a>

    <!--The example image kind of makes this section look like a set of drop-down options except for the last option
    for logging in. And by "making it look like" I mean it looks like what I would usually except a set of drop-downs
    to look like whenever I encounter them on webpages. If they are intended to be drop-downs, my main guess is that
    we will have to use <select> and use CSS to make the option appear like it does in the image (ie. the title of the
    option), and then have a "hover" property when a user places their cursor over the option for whatever the "options"
    are for that...option. But again, for the sake of placeholders, it seems like <a> is a good option for now.-->

    the difference in text size for this section until we start incorporating CSS.-->

    <!--Again, more clickable content that will take the user to another part of the webpage. <a> again seems like
    the most logical guess for the HTML. Still assuming that JS will play a big role in handling that functionality
    as was previously discussed.-->

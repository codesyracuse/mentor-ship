# Welcome Emails to Mentors
## Version 1

**Subject:** CODES Training Program Match  
  
**Body**  
{MENTOR},  
  
We received a training request from {TRAINEE}, attached.  
  
Assuming you agree to the match, a fast start is possible.  
  
Getting started means getting prepared. We have a small amount of structure set up to demo to you. Are you available for a zoom call this coming {DATE_AND_TIME} to discuss?  
  
  
Happy Summer.

## Version 2
**Subject:** CODES Mentorship Match  
  
**Body**  
{MENTOR}  

Four trainees have requested python. From a woman who does not own a laptop to a man who is graduating a master's program, there are widely different backgrounds represented by the training requests.  
  
Maybe options are useful. There's no need to decide now.  
  
We've placed one training pair, are placing another, and with you, we would place another pair.  
  
Getting started is a conversation. Would you be available {DATE_AND_TIME}? We'd have a couple CODES board members on the call with you to discuss the options.  
  
Happy coding.

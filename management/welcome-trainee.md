# Welcome Emails to Trainees
## Version 1

**Subject:** CODES Training Program Match  
  
**Body**  
{TRAINEE},  
  
We have identified a cybersecurity professional to be your trainer.  
  
Assuming you agree to the match, a fast start is possible.  
  
Getting started means getting prepared. We have a small amount of structure set up to demo to you. Are you available for a zoom call this coming {DATE_AND_TIME} to discuss?  
  
Happy Summer.

## Version 2
**Subject:** CODES Trainer Match  
  
**Body**  
{TRAINEE}  
  
We have set up {MENTOR} as your trainer. We can meet next {DATE_AND_TIME}, assuming you are available to introduce yourself.  
  
From there, you and {MENTOR} will be going forward independently.  
  
Does that work for you?

## Version 3
**Subject:** CODES Mentor Ship  
  
**Body**  
{TRAINEE}  
  
I spoke with {MENTOR}. We reviewed the mentor ship program for trainers.  
  
When in the coming week is a good time for you and I to go over the mentor ship program for you?  
  
What will we cover? The length of the program is in 6 week increments and the expectation is that you meet your mentor 30 minutes per week.

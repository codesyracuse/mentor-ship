# SMART
## Specific
The CICD pipeline manages the autonomous validation of code.  This task
creates a slack channel, then notifies that channel when the build
starts.  Upon completion, the result of the build is posted into the 
slack channel.


## Measurable
The end goal is to create a github repo and add a circleci build 
pipeline to the project.  

## Attainable
